# Income-Distribution-and-Electricity-Affordability
This repository contains a simulated income distribution for 48 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and an estimated electricity affordability for residents in each country. The code supports the study published in "Assessing Grid Affordability for Universal Electricity Access in Sub-Saharan Africa."

## Scripts
- ***Electricity_Tariff_Calculator.xlxs:***
  This database includes the latest residential electricity tariffs for 48 SSA countries and estimates monthly electricity bills based on the Multi-Tier Framework (MTF).
- ***Summary_Electricity_Bills.xlxs:***
  This dataset contains the calculated monthly residential electricity bills for each tier across 48 SSA countries, standardized to 2024 US dollars.
- ***Data input.xlxs:***
  This dataset compiles raw data, including the GINI index, Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, the 2024 population for each country, and monthly electricity bills (in US dollars) for each tier.
- ***Code.ipynb:***
  This notebook utilizes the input dataset "Data_Input.xlsx" to simulate income distribution and calculate residential electricity affordability. Affordability is assessed by expressing monthly electricity bills (in US dollars) as a share of income.
- ***Country_Affordability_Results.xlsx:***
  This Excel sheet presents the results generated from the income simulation model and electricity affordability calculation.
